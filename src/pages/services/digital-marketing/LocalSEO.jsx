const faqs = [
  {
    question: "How Do Local SEO Services Differ from Traditional SEO?",
    answer:
      "Traditional SEO focuses on ranking your website globally or nationally for broad terms (e.g., best laptops), while Local SEO services zero in on your geographic area—like laptop repair in Toronto. Local SEO leverages tools like Google Maps and the Map Pack, emphasizing proximity and relevance to searchers nearby. For brick-and-mortar stores or service providers, this hyper-local focus drives foot traffic and phone calls, making local search optimization a must.",
  },
  {
    question: "How Long Does It Take to See Results with Local SEO Services?",
    answer: "Results from Local SEO services typically start showing within 3–6 months, though timelines vary. Factors like your current online presence, local competition, and industry play a role. For example, a new cafe in a busy city might see faster Map Pack gains with consistent Google Business Profile optimization, while a niche service in a small town could take longer to climb rankings. Patience pays off—once you’re ranking, the organic traffic is steady and cost-effective",
  },
  {
    question: "Can Local SEO Services Help If I Already Run Paid Ads?",
    answer: "Absolutely! Paid ads deliver quick visibility, but Local SEO services build a lasting foundation. Ads stop working when the budget runs out, whereas local business SEO keeps you ranking organically over time. Combining the two is even better—ads grab immediate attention, while SEO nurtures trust and credibility through reviews, citations, and optimized content. It’s a one-two punch for dominating local searches.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do Small Businesses Really Need Local SEO Services?",
    answer: "Yes, especially if you rely on local customers! Whether you’re a plumber, retailer, or restaurant owner, Local SEO services level the playing field against bigger brands. They boost your local search visibility, helping you appear in the Map Pack and outrank competitors for searches like florist near me. Small businesses thrive when locals can find them easily—think more walk-ins, calls, and sales without breaking the bank on ads.",
  },
  {
    question: "What’s Included in a Typical Local SEO Service Package?",
    answer: "A solid Local SEO services package covers the essentials: Google Business Profile optimization (photos, posts, and details), citation management (consistent NAP across directories), local keyword research, on-page SEO (location-specific content), review strategies, and local backlink building. Some providers, like us, also offer technical SEO (site speed, mobile-friendliness) and detailed reporting. It’s a holistic approach to make your business a local standout.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can Local SEO Services Improve My Google Maps Ranking?",
    answer: "Yes, that’s a core benefit! Local SEO services target Google Maps rankings by optimizing your GBP, ensuring NAP consistency, and gathering positive reviews—all signals Google loves. Backlinks from local sites and keyword-rich content also help. Landing in the Map Pack (those top 3 map results) can skyrocket your visibility, driving more customers to your door.",
